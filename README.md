**Food Delivery Demand Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting restaurant demand using a dataset from FoodHub, a popular food delivery aggregator. The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing demand and develop a predictive model to forecast future demand for restaurants.


**Data Overview**
The dataset used in this project includes historical data on food orders from various restaurants partnered with FoodHub. The key features include:

Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant.
Order Date: Date and time of the order.
Rating: Customer rating of the restaurant.
Order Quantity: Number of orders placed.
Additional Features: Other features related to the restaurant and customer demographics.


**Data Preprocessing:**

Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.
Conducted statistical analysis to understand the distribution of key features.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features to improve model performance.
Selected relevant features for modeling.
Predictive Modeling:

Applied machine learning algorithms to predict restaurant demand.
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
Data Visualization:

Created visualizations to present findings and model results.

**Key Skills Learned**

Data Analysis: Techniques for cleaning, processing, and analyzing large datasets.
Demand Forecasting: Methods for predicting future demand using historical data.
Machine Learning: Applied machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to communicate findings.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted statistical tests and analyses to validate results.
**Results**
The predictive model developed in this project successfully forecasted restaurant demand with a high degree of accuracy. The model's predictions can be used by FoodHub to optimize their operations, allocate resources efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction.
